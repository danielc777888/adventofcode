- To compile : ghc Day6_2.hs -o Day6_2.out -rtsopts -O2
- To execute : cat Day6_input | time ./Day6_2.out +RTS -sstderr
- To use an external module add entry to your cabal file : x2015.cabal
- To run specific exe using cabal : cat Day4_input_ex1 | time cabal run Day4_2 +RTS -sstderr

## goals
- master solving challenging problems with a pure lazy functional programming language ie.haskell
- be able to solve all aoc challenges on same day. Not aiming for speed, rather for elegance and beauty.
- learn haskell/ghc ecosystem/language, algorithms, data structures and domains (math, geometry, bioinformatics, etc.)
- complete all problems from 2015 ->
